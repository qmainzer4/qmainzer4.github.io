                Hello! My name is Quade Mainzer. I am a senior at the University of Alabama, pursuing a double major in English 
                and mathematics, with minors in actuarial science and computing technology and applications. Additionally, I am student
                in the accelerated masters program for mathematics.
            <p>
            
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Hinckley, Ohioâ€”home of the buzzards and the Great Hinckley Hunt. In 2022, I served as 
                the editor of the 2022 edition of New College Review and have been published in the Marr's Field Journal;
                both are undergraduate magazines at the University of Alabama.            
            
            <p>
                As the president of the English Majors and Minors Association, I help conduct creative writing workshops 
                at Woodland Forrest Elementary School. I am an escape room enthusiast and a juggling unicycler who hopes 
                to write murder mysteries, board game instructions, and calculus textbooks after graduation. I look forward 
                to another great semester with everyone!            
            <p>
