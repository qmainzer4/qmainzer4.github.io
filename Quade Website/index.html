                Hello! My name is Quade Mainzer, continuing with the University of Alabama Press this
semester. I am an undergraduate senior pursuing majors in English and mathematics with minors
in actuarial science and computing technology and applications.
            <p>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in
                Hinckley, Ohioâ€”home of the buzzards and the Great Hinckley Hunt. I was the editor for the
                2022 edition of the New College Review and have been published in the Marr's Field Journal;
                both are undergraduate magazines on campus.            <p>
                
                    As the president of the English Majors and Minors
                    Association, I help conduct creative writing workshops at Woodland Forrest Elementary School.
                    I am an escape room enthusiast and a juggling unicycler who hopes to write murder mysteries,
                    board game instructions, and calculus textbooks after graduation. I look forward to another great
                    semester with everyone!            
                    <p>
